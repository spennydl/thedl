Thank you for visiting my humble blog!  I write here about stuff I find interesting, and about
the silly projects I work on in my spare time.

Spencer is a software developer in Vancouver, Canada.

At work, she's responsible for:
- Building out and maintaining an on-demand hosting platform for a large, spring-based e-commerce platform on AWS
  that is used by the sales organization within the company.
- Leading a fast-paced team of super smart developers that build increasingly complex sales demos in short time frames.
- Expertly engineering demos of how we provide effective solutions for prospective customer's biggest e-commerce pain points.
- Writing clean, simple, and easily maintained code in many languages and frameworks including Java, Spring, Javascript, React, Bash, Go, C++, Rust... etc
- Moving mountains in record time.

Some of her favorite things are:
- Drinking great coffee (black as midnight on a moonless night)
- Building cool things (she's pretty proud of the SID6581 MIDI synth she built)
- Sim racing (these days she plays a lot of Dirt Rally 2.0, GT Sport, and Project Cars 2.  She's pretty fast.)

You can usually find her goofing around on [github](https://github.com/spennydl) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/bigspennyj).

It's my goal that the content presented on this site is both fun and informative.  You should have fun
reading it and walk away with some new knowledge, even if it's just a few new "useless" facts.

The site is just getting off the ground, but I'd love to hear your feedback!  To provide a place for 
discussion I often post about articles I write on reddit or twitter, but if you want to reach me
directly I'd love to hear from you!
